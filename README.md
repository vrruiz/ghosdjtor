# [Ghosdjtor](https://github.com/vrruiz/ghosdjtor): Ghost Markdown Editor for Django

This is a port to Django of [Ghostditor](https://github.com/durgesh-priyaranjan/ghosditor/), a Markdown editor derived from [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost) blogging platform. Ghosditor is a [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) app. The current **Ghosdjtor** port uses Django 1.6.

> Ghost markdown editor not just allows user to upload image, it also gives you luxury to have image placeholders. So that you can focus on writing in your flow.

### Background

**Ghosditor** is an standalone markdown editor derived from the open source [repo of Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost) blogging engine. The original attempt to extract out editor from **Ghost** was done by [Tim Badolato](https://github.com/timsayshey) which can be found at [Ghost-Markdown-Edito]r(https://github.com/timsayshey/Ghost-Markdown-Editor).
